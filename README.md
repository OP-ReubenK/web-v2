Final Web assignment

Replicate of “Discovered Wildfoods” web application by Reuben Koks, 2021.
I have made an attempt at recreating discoveredfoods.com. a website that markets wild venison and meats as well as providing recipe ideas and other information regarding wild meats. My version is a bit more limited, as once I began to understand how much there really was going on, I had to reign in my scope of what I could achieve.
My reasoning to choose this design was that I really liked the lay out and the natural wood and foliage colours. I scrolled down the page to see that nearly everything was alive somehow, and that all the elements would all move and rotate. 
It, at first glance, didn’t look too challenging but also didn’t look too easy. It did turn out to be hiding so much more under the hood. Nearly everything is in its own div and has its own controls. Everything moves independently but also together in a very attractive flow. 
My version lacks a lot of the functionality but represents some of the understanding I began to have in how various things worked. I was very pleased with the mouse that has a ring, which inverts some clickable elements, and I was happy with how the 2 hidden menus ended up working. 
I also embedded a wee game in one of the pop-ups just as a learning adventure. I did originally want to embed DOOM but it broke my website in serious ways in the 11th hour so was abandoned. 
This was a very steep learning curve for me, but I really did enjoy creating this. 

The project is using both Node and in deployed to Heroku. Typing in “npm start” into visual studios terminal with launch the application under the address “localhost:3000” and clicking on the link https://nameless-gorge-25868.herokuapp.com/ will take the user to the Heroku hosted version.

Thank you to Kaitlin Bull, who helped with the mouse over coding as well as a multitude of other issues, and Adon Moskal, who was coach and trouble shooter.
